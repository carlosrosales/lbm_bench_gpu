v14.0 - 2011/03/11 - CRF
========================
* Stats and runlog outputs changed to double precision. Code speed not affected.

v13.0 - 2011/03/11 - CRF
========================
* Bugfix: fixed value of <uz> in stats.c

v12.0 - 2011/01/06 - CRF
========================
* Return to v10 because it was faster. Using force along z because I want
  larger domains along z so that the MPI exchange is less expensive.
* Removed irrelevant output to stdout from vgrid(). 
* Added cudaEventSynchronize() after each cudaEventRecord()

v11.0 - 2011/02/16 - CRF
========================
* Reduce number of device/host memory transfers and MPI exchanges in the main 
  evolution loop from 3 to 2 by exchanging all components of the f distribution
  function from the real nodes on the boundary to the ghosts after the stream
  step. This allows the phi calculation to be extended to the ghosts in the 
  update_phi() kernel.

v10.0 - 2011/01/06 - CRF
=======================
* Added synchronization point just before calculating time spent in each 
  section. This fixes the "Evolution Time = 0" problem.
* Code validates vs serial GPU code up to 1000 iterations on 2 GPUs. 

v9.0 - 2010/12/09 - CRF
=======================
* More complete output, runlog.out is updated after setup, relaxation, and 
  evolution stages to keep the relevant relaxation data intact.
    ** Old version called finalsave.c changed to logsave.c.
    ** Output records GPU name and memory size
* Errors in main.cu directed to stderr
* Info in main.cu directed to stdout
* Phi, rho and velocity updated in individual kernels

v8.0 - 2010/12/08 - CRF
=======================
* Removed all cudaGetLastError()
* Removed redundant cudaThreadSync() calls. Those following a cudaMalloc() are 
  not needed because cudaMalloc is a blocking operation. Those in between 
  kernels are not necessary becasue the kernels are executed serially and I am
  using always the same blocking partition. Those following a host function call
  are also unnecessary.

v7.0 - 2010/12/08 - CRF
=======================
* Fixed error in top_snd/top_snd_d and bot_snd/bot_snd_d copy
* First working version

v6.0 - 2010/12/08 - CRF
=======================
* Still not working
* Super-Debug version
* Includes cudaGetLastError checks after every kernel
* Non-blocking communication in MPI exchanges

v5.0 - 2010/10/11 - CRF
=======================
* Parallelization changed to z direction
* Still not working

v4.0 - 2010/10/11 - CRF
=======================
* Simplified error output

v3.0 - 2010/09/13 - CRF
=======================
* Added MPI exchange of processor boundary phi values so that the calculated 
  Laplacian of Phi is correct in the collision step.

v2.0 - 2010/09/07 - CRF
=======================
* Substituted "relax" related functions as in v4.0 of standard code.

* PERFORMANCE NOTES
** Need to reconsider partitioning for the kernels dealing with MPI exchange
** Substitute Sendrcv by Isend/Ircv
** Use two streams and asynchronous data exchange to hide data movement between
   host and device

v1.0 - 2010/09/03 - CRF
=======================
* Based on v3.0 of single bubble CUDA code
* GPU device and domain distribution amongst CPUs validated.
